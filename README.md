# Project Euler

Here are my solutions to some of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). I highly encourage anyone looking at this page to not look at my solved problems at all for the sake of solving them on your own. My solutions are not always the best most optimized way of doing a problem, but they do work. Most are written in Python version 2.5 with the exception of some which are in Java. The newest ones are in Python 3. Progress so far : 93 problems solved.
